      <description>&lt;p&gt;For me, photography is the intentional noticing of things. When I walk to work in the morning, the scenery becomes dull with each passing season as I grow used to the imagery. If I have my camera and walk with intention, then I being to &lt;em&gt;notice&lt;/em&gt;. I see elements of architecture, of nature, and of people that I would otherwise miss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first purchased a &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; camera (the Ricoh GR IIIx), it was for my upcoming &amp;ldquo;trip&amp;rdquo; to Tokyo, Japan (this trip was intended to be 1 year of research in a lab at the University of Tokyo, but I remain in that lab, 2.5 years later).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Discovering research: Why I came to Japan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to say about what led me to applying for a JSPS fellowship to afford me a year of independent research in Japan. It is difficult, though, to identify the causal links from one moment to the next leading up to that point in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So instead, I have been thinking about my motivations at the time and what I envisaged from my time in Japan. I hope that distilling this will allow me to make the most of my time here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
