            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to say about what led me to applying for a JSPS fellowship to afford me a year of independent research in Japan. It is difficult, though, to identify the causal links from one moment to the next leading up to that point in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, I have been thinking about my motivations at the time and what I envisaged from my time in Japan. I hope that distilling this will allow me to make the most of my time here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
