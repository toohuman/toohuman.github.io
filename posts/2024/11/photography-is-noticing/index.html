One minute</p></div><article><h1 class=post-title><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/2024/11/photography-is-noticing/>Photography is noticing</a></h1><div class=post-content><p>For me, photography is the intentional noticing of things. When I walk to work in the morning, the scenery becomes dull with each passing season as I grow used to the imagery. If I have my camera and walk with intention, then I being to <em>notice</em>. I see elements of architecture, of nature, and of people that I would otherwise miss.</p><p>When I first purchased a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; camera (the Ricoh GR IIIx), it was for my upcoming &ldquo;trip&rdquo; to Tokyo, Japan (this trip was intended to be 1 year of research in a lab at the University of Tokyo, but I remain in that lab, 2.5 years later).</p><p>This year I &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; (kinda) to a more professional camera: the Fujifilm X-T5. I wanted an interchangeable lens camera and also, perhaps more importantly, I wanted something more weatherproof and robust. While the Ricoh is an amazing camera, and a true everyday carry, I felt there were times when the weather in Tokyo created the perfect conditions for street photography with puddles galore providing extra illuminations, but the fear of getting my Ricoh wet would mean I would have to cradle an umbrella the whole time which sometimes becomes quite stressful to manage in more crowded areas of Tokyo.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>
